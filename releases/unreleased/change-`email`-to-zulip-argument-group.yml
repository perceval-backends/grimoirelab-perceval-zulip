title: Change `email` to zulip argument group
category: fixed
author: Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula <venu@chaoss.community>
issue: 1
notes: >
    The current implementation uses `token_auth` and supports 
    `email` as an argument. But, `email` is not an optional
    argument. The auth fails if no `email` is provided.

    To handle this, the email is moved to a new zulip argument
    group. Now, it throws an error is `email` is missing.
