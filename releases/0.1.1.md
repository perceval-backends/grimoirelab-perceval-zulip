## perceval-zulip 0.1.1 - (2021-09-22)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Change `email` to zulip argument group (#1)\
   The current implementation uses `token_auth` and supports  `email` as
   an argument. But, `email` is not an optional argument. The auth fails
   if no `email` is provided. To handle this, the email is moved to a new
   zulip argument group. Now, it throws an error is `email` is missing.
